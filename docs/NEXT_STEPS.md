# Next Steps

1. Wire dependency installation + smoke script (`make smoke` or equivalent) to run health/tests quickly in nightly runs
2. Add OpenRouter response parser utility to safely extract assistant text from completion payload
3. Connect `/analyze` to OpenRouter behind the existing response contract, with mock fallback for local/dev mode
