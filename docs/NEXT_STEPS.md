# Next Steps

1. Add route-level error mapping for OpenRouter failures (config/request/timeout/parse) so API responses stay explicit and debuggable
2. Parse structured OpenRouter output (themes/opportunities/experiments) into first-class response fields instead of mock-derived placeholders
3. Add a minimal README quickstart for local and devcontainer workflows (mode flags, smoke command, env vars)
