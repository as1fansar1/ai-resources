# Next Steps

1. Parse structured OpenRouter output (themes/opportunities/experiments) into first-class response fields instead of mock-derived placeholders
2. Add a minimal README quickstart for local and devcontainer workflows (mode flags, smoke command, env vars)
3. Add OpenAPI error response docs for `/analyze` (codes + error payload schema) so client handling is contract-driven
