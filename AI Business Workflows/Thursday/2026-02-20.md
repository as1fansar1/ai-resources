# Thursday — Sales AI Business Workflows
**Date pulled:** 2026-02-20 (UTC)
**Window targeted:** last 30 days
**Theme:** How businesses are using AI to replace/automate sales functions

## Executive Summary
Based on YouTube + web source pulls, the strongest recurring pattern is **AI SDR-style automation** replacing large parts of manual top-of-funnel and mid-funnel execution:
- prospect research + personalization
- inbound qualification
- follow-up sequencing
- meeting handoff/booking
- CRM hygiene + lead prioritization

## Top 5 Practical Use Cases (Sales)
1. **Outbound research + personalization automation**
   - AI assembles account/prospect context and drafts personalized outreach.
2. **Inbound lead qualification triage**
   - AI scores and routes inbound leads (hot/warm/nurture/disqualify) before human reps engage.
3. **Automated follow-up sequences**
   - AI handles multi-step, rules-based follow-ups and timing.
4. **Meeting booking + handoff orchestration**
   - AI moves qualified prospects into scheduling/handoff flows.
5. **CRM updates + pipeline prioritization**
   - AI updates records and keeps rep focus on highest-likelihood opportunities.

## Best Use Case to Implement First
**Inbound lead qualification copilot**

### Why first
- Lowest disruption to current team behavior.
- Immediate speed-to-response improvement.
- Clear KPI impact in days (response time, qualified leads, meetings booked).

## OpenClaw Workflow Mapping (v1)
1. **Trigger:** daily cron (Thursday sales deep-dive + daily morning triage)
2. **Ingest:** pull new lead inputs/messages/source notes
3. **Classify:** hot/warm/nurture/disqualify
4. **Draft:** suggested next action + message draft
5. **Output:** concise action brief for manual approve/send

## Suggested Pilot KPIs (7-day pilot)
- # qualified leads/day
- avg response-time-to-new-lead
- # meetings booked
- % leads auto-triaged without manual correction

## Source Confidence Notes
- **Medium confidence overall** (good directional signal; heavy vendor/operator content)
- **Known limitations in this run:**
  - Reddit path hit rate limits (429)
  - X/Twitter path returned 403
  - YouTube transcripts were mostly unavailable
