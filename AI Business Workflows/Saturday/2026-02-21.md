# Saturday — HR/Recruiting AI Business Workflows
**Date pulled:** 2026-02-21 (UTC)
**Window targeted:** last 30 days
**Theme:** How businesses are using AI to replace/automate HR and recruiting functions

## Executive Summary
Recent signal shows AI is replacing high-volume, repetitive recruiting work first: intake triage, screening prep, scheduling orchestration, and ATS workflow updates. Human recruiters stay focused on judgment-heavy decisions and candidate experience.

## Top 5 Practical Use Cases (HR/Recruiting)
1. **Candidate intake + screening automation**
   - AI parses resumes/profiles, scores fit, and prepares shortlist-ready summaries.
2. **Recruiter outreach + scheduling copilot**
   - AI drafts outreach and coordinates interview scheduling automatically.
3. **Interview support + standardized evaluation**
   - AI helps generate structured interview notes and rubric-based candidate scoring.
4. **ATS/HRIS workflow automation**
   - AI updates pipeline stages, reminders, and handoffs across recruiting systems.
5. **HR helpdesk/self-service automation**
   - AI handles repetitive policy/process questions and routes edge cases to humans.

## Best Use Case to Implement First
**Candidate intake + triage copilot**

### Why first
- Quickest measurable value (faster screening throughput).
- Low implementation risk relative to full interview automation.
- Improves recruiter focus on top candidates and high-quality interactions.

## OpenClaw Workflow Mapping (v1)
1. **Trigger:** daily recruiting digest (or on-demand run)
2. **Ingest:** new candidate inputs (resume text, notes, role criteria)
3. **Classify:** fit tier + risk flags + missing info
4. **Draft:** recruiter-ready shortlist notes + next-step recommendation
5. **Output:** action queue (review now / hold / reject with reason)

## Suggested Pilot KPIs (7-day pilot)
- screening turnaround time
- % candidates triaged without manual rework
- shortlist quality (hiring manager acceptance rate)
- recruiter time saved per day

## Source Confidence Notes
- **Medium confidence overall** for this run.
- Limitations:
  - Reddit path returned rate limit (429)
  - X path returned auth/permission error (403)
  - YouTube signal available but transcript depth limited
- Strongest signal came from web/operator and platform guidance sources.
